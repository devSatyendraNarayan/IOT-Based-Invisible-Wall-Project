# Invisible Wall Project

## Overview
The Invisible Wall Project is a security system designed to prevent unauthorized activities at critical locations. Its purpose is to control the entry of unauthorized vehicles into sensitive areas without visible barriers.

## Key Features
- Control system at checkpoints
- Hidden spiked strips in the road
- Concealed pit for emergency vehicle stoppage
- Switch-operated mechanism

## How It Works
1. When a suspicious vehicle is identified, security personnel activate a switch.
2. Hidden spiked strips emerge to puncture the vehicle's tires.
3. A concealed pit ahead opens, causing the vehicle to stop.
4. Security personnel can then control the vehicle and its occupants.
